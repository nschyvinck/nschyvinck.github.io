		<h2> Welcome! On this website, you will find recommendations of two areas to visit in Minnesota based off of my personal experiences. </h2>
		<p> While I grew up in the Chicago suburbs, most of my family lives in Minnesota, and I have been lucky to spend lots of time there throughout my life. I have fallen in love with both the Twin Cities, and all of the surrounding areas full of beautiful nature. This travel guide includes recommendations based off of places that I have been and loved. Specifically, I will help you plan meals and activities in the <b>Twin Cities</b> and the <b>North Shore</b>.</p>
